# The Dancing Plague of 1518

> *A story-driven historical website about the strange and chilling real-life event where hundreds danced uncontrollably — some to their deaths.*

## 🕰️ Inspiration

I’ve always been fascinated by unusual historical phenomena. The Dancing Plague of 1518 stands out as one of the strangest and least understood. I wanted to bring this forgotten story to life through an engaging and informative webpage that reads like a timeline-driven narrative.

## 🧠 What it does

This is a story-focused website that guides users through the timeline of the dancing plague with vivid descriptions, historical quotes, and interactive visual elements. It's meant to feel like you're stepping into the pages of history.

## 🛠️ How I built it

- HTML for the structure  
- CSS (with Google Fonts) for custom aesthetic styling  
- JavaScript for smooth scrolling and quote box interactivity  
- Images are used to help convey the mood and period atmosphere  
- No frameworks or back-end — it’s a purely front-end static site

## 🚧 Challenges I ran into

- Finding a balance between storytelling and web design.
- Making the design visually appealing without using any CSS frameworks.
- Locating historical imagery and quotes that are both accurate and accessible.
- Working solo meant managing all design, development, and content decisions myself.

## ✅ Accomplishments that I'm proud of

- Bringing a lesser-known historical event to life in an accessible and engaging format.
- Creating a polished, scroll-driven story with strong visual theming.
- Learned how to structure a fully custom site using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

## 📚 What I learned

- Better understanding of storytelling through web design
- Improved CSS layout and font usage for readability and theme
- Practice with semantic HTML and responsive design choices

## 🔮 What's next for this project
- Voice narration for key sections of the story
- More historical events told through similar narrative timelines
