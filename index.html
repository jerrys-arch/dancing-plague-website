      <h2>July 1518: The First Dancer</h2>
      <p>It began with Frau Troffea, who stepped into the street and began dancing uncontrollably. She danced for days without rest, seemingly unable to stop despite exhaustion and pain. Her strange behavior quickly drew attention from the townspeople, who were baffled and concerned by this inexplicable compulsion. This event marked the start of an unusual and tragic epidemic that would grip the city of Strasbourg.</p>

      <h2>The Contagion Spreads</h2>
      <p>Within weeks, over 400 people had joined the dancing frenzy. The dancers were not celebrating or enjoying themselves; rather, they appeared to be in a trance-like state, driven by a force beyond their control. Exhaustion and injuries soon followed, as many danced for hours on end without breaks. Some dancers collapsed and died from strokes, heart attacks, or sheer physical breakdown, their feet often bloodied and raw from the relentless movement.</p>

      <h2>Authorities Respond</h2>
      <p>The city’s leaders believed that more dancing would cure the dancers of their affliction. In a desperate attempt to heal them, guildhalls were opened and musicians hired to keep the dancers moving. The idea was that by dancing continuously, the dancers would expel whatever was tormenting them. Instead, this approach only intensified the epidemic, as it encouraged the afflicted to push themselves even harder despite their deteriorating health.</p>

      <h2>Voices from the Margins</h2>
      <p>Most of the dancers were women, many from poor and marginalized backgrounds, whose perspectives were largely ignored in contemporary accounts. Their suffering was profound and largely undocumented, except through the eyes of others. These women were often vulnerable members of society, and their involuntary dancing can be seen as a form of collective distress manifesting physically in a community under extreme pressure and hardship.</p>

      <h2>What Caused It?</h2>
      <p>Historians and scientists have proposed several theories to explain the dancing plague. One hypothesis is ergot poisoning, caused by consuming rye bread contaminated with a toxic fungus that induces hallucinations and convulsions. Another explanation suggests mass psychogenic illness, where collective stress and trauma manifest as involuntary movements in a crowd. Others point to religious fervor or social and economic tensions as triggers. Despite centuries of research, the exact cause remains a mystery.</p>

      <h2>The End and the Legacy</h2>
      <p>The dancing abruptly stopped after several months, as suddenly as it had started, leaving the city exhausted but relieved. The event has since fascinated historians, psychologists, and artists, becoming a symbol of the power of collective human behavior under stress. It continues to inform studies on mass hysteria, social contagion, and the complex interplay between mind and body during crises.</p>
